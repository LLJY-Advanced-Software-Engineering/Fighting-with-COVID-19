# Supply-Chain-of-PPE

This project model how the supply and demand for the PPE varies during COVID-19 for the healthcare workers to be able to meet their demands

For example, hospital already has certain stock of PPE

New patients come for a result of COVID test, more PPE is required by the hospital which was not anticipated, hospital must ask supplier for more PPE, however, other hospitals are in the same situation, and PPE demand suddenly increases, as a result, supply falls short.
